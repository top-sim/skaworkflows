HPSO observation information is stored in a csv file.

    observations : list

        The maximum percentage of the telescope to be occupied at any given

    Notes
    -----
    Observation scheduling is normally a challenging process and quite
    bespoke. The observation schedules we generate are therefore going to be
    made according to the following heuristic:

        * Start with the largest observation (size) in the list
            * This is tie broken on duration
        * If there are any more observations that fit on the telescope at the
        the same time, we add these to the plan too.
        * The longest observation should be followed by at least one small
        observation
        * observations that are small are selected until they reach the limit
        * at least 2 smaller observed until the next larger observations are
        selected
