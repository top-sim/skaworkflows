# SKAWorkflows

This repository stores data and translator scripts to convert HPSO data produced  by the SDP Parametric model into a mid-term Observation Schedule, for use during a TOpSim simulation. 
 
   
To do so, this provides the following modules, which may work separately or in conjunction with others to produce a complete Telescope Observation Plan, complete with observation-specific workflows translated from ICRAR's [EAGLE editor](http://eagle.icrar.org). 

TBD
