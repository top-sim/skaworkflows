This set of pages describes the processes underlying the generation of TopSim
configuration files and pipelines. These pipelines form the basis of
experiments used to evaluate different scheduling approaches' performance when
applied to workflow scheduling for the Square Kilometre Array Sciene Data
Processor (SKA SDP). 

Pipelines are generated based on information including the observation
schedule, theoretical system sizing of pipeline components, and a Logical Graph
Template produced by the `EAGLE <https://eagle.icrar.org/>`_ online graph editor. 

The source coderepository is found under the
